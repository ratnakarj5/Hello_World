Branching is the way to work on different parts of a repository at one time.

When you create a repository, by default it has one branch with the name master. You could keep working on this branch and have only one, that’s fine. But if you have another feature or idea you want to work on, you can create another branch, starting from master, so that you can leave master in its working state.

When you create a branch, you’re making a copy of the original branch as it was at that point in time (like a photo snapshot). If the original branch changes while you’re working on your new branch, no worries, you can always pull in those updates.
